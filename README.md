Reality
=======

Version: Build 3
================

(See how to run the download and run the game at the bottom.)

Reality is a project mainly ran by Zambonie. Turtle5204, brang up the idea of making a game, and I accepted that. This game is written
in C#, and using Monogame as its framework. Reality is a 2D sandbox game with quests, and a pretty good plot.

Reality is currently in pre-alpha, meaning that you shouldn't expect to much from it, its out there for testing and opinions on the game.

Reality started in late 2013, when it was first made in Java, with LWJGL (OpenGL). I had found many FPS issues and coding complexities, so
I decided to create the game in C#, with Monogame (DirectX). Monogame was so much simpler to work with, and had higher FPS.
Since 2013, There had been many put on hold periods for stuff like school and vacations, and a complete re-write from Java to C#.

For those who wonder what the game's plot will be in the future once I get to it, here is my original comment on skype from when I was making the plot:

<<< In the year 3047, Earth has been Disbannded by many people. It is in Horrible Condition. Buildings have fallen, Climate controll has been devastated, Oxygen Levels are unstable, Sea levels have rosen. There are only a few people left on earth, and there are 3 main survial groups. The Apel, located in Central America, The Epel, Localated in central Europe, and the Rpel, located in southern Russia. There are 2 other dying groups, Aupel, in central Austalia, Where the sea has covered most of the land now. Also Spel, located in South africa. You will be automaticly assigned to a group, and your goal is to try surviving with these harsh conditions. Fortently, many technologys have been created. Such as a oxygen bubble distrubitor, and a LSD (Life saving Device). The life saving device will use any sort of metal and as much as it can to revive once you have died. And Oxygen Distrubuter is powered off greens (Lettuce, Vegis, plants) in your invetory. You dont want to keep the Distributer on al the time, nor keep it off all the time. The Group you will be assigned to will give you the most basic starting items you can, and will support you all hte way out. They will give you food for a very cheap price, as well as provide you  a very basic sleeping area for the first 2 days. You goal is to recreate Hummanity, and restore Life.
(Note: I noticed that there are many typos in this, I'll fix them later.)

Please report any bugs and suggest some suggestions.
Thanks, -Zambonie.
